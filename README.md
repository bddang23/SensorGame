# SensorGame
This project is from group 3 in the CIS403 - Mobile App Development Class. 

Our app will be a game that will have a character and interacts with the sensors in three ways. 
Firstly, we will be using the ambient light sensor to put the character to sleep when the light levels are lowered. 
The second sensor will be the accelerometer that will be used either wake the character up when you shake the phone
or to make the character jump when the phone is tossed in the air. The height from the jump and time to complete all 
tasks will be stored in shared preferences to save the users high scores on a results page.
